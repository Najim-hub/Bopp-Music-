 Current problem in the music

     Underpaid artists
PRO-RATA MODEL
Most streaming platforms pay artists by pooling revenue and distributing based on stream count. Which doesn't help small artists.
EARNING BELOW MINIMUM WAGE
On average, most artists need a minimum 300,000 monthly streams to earn a minimum wage in the United states.
  
   Lack of control
"MASTERS" IS A PHRASE MOST USED IN THE MUSIC INDSUTRY. IT REFERS TO THE RIGHTS TO A SONG. MOST ARTISTS DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO THEIR MUSIC.
  
  NO
TRANSPARENCY
CENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE
These two points go hand in hand. Essentially, large streaming platforms control the flow of data. So, commonly, artists never know their true earning potentials because these organization never disclose this information. All the governance lies in the hand of the streaming platform which creates inefficiencies.
  
Solution
  FULL PAYMENT TO ARTISTS
A zero commission music streaming platform
FULL CONTROL TO ARTISTS
Artists have full rights to their music as compared to the inefficient streaming model.
COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY AND OPEN GOVERNANCE
Creating a self-sustaining music ecosystem whereby artists, producers, songwriters, and fans can play a vital role in managing and developing the platform.
 
     FULL PAYMENT TO ARTISTS
We plan to eliminate platform fees and give the artist back the total value from their music sales. A zero-commission model will lead to better income for artists, who, in return, will pass on some of the matter to the fans by investing in their music and themselves.
 
 Full control and rights to artists
 MUSIC DISTRIBUTION
Bopp decentralized platform will allow artists to distribute their music from a unique ETH wallet address
NO THIRD PARTY IS INVOLVED
it’s a direct transaction between the fan and the artist.
REVENUE SHARING
Artists no longer need to pay any streaming platform to distribute their music, neither do they have to share revenue with any record label.
    
  COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY
Bopp’s decentralized music streaming platform will allow users a higher level of transparency. All the transactions will be recorded on the blockchain. Every transaction will be made visible, which creates the highest level of transparency.
 OPEN GOVERNANCE
Bopp is creating a self- sustaining music ecosystem whereby artists, producers, songwriters, and fans can play a vital role in managing and developing the platform. Bopp believes not one entity knows what works best for each artist or lover, so Bopp will be produced as a platform whereby each platform can use it how it fits them best.
 
  MUSIC OWNERSHIP
A shift away from the current model of pay as you go. Fans now own the music they purchase, this the next step in the music industry.
   MUSIC 3.0
  
 Blockchain Technology
 FULL TRANSPARENCY
The Ethereum blockchain brings a high level of transparency into the music industry. It massively increases the efficiency by which all parties on the platforms operate
OPEN GOVERNANCE
Bopp holders stake their tokens, which gives them voting rights in upgrades in the Bopp music app
DECENTRALIZATION
Bopp music will be a decentralized protocol. So, the authority needed to make decisions will not belong to the Bopp team. Instead, it will be the community.
    
Smart Contract Implementation
  ETHEREUM
Our smart contracts are written in solidity, which is the native language of the Ethereum blockchain. The contracts are complied with using truffle.
MAIN CONTRACT
The main contract is the music contract: When songs are added by artists on Bopp, they get uploaded directly onto the Ethereum blockchain, with a unique hash. The user that mints this song is the owner of this unique hash, they then disturb the music onto the Bopp marketplace.
    
Bopp User Interface
The beta app is currently on the app store while we await further funding to develop the marketplace section of our app. This will offer full functionality and allow users enjoy the complete experience of Bopp Music

# Bopp Music Inc

### Overview 

Bopp — an innovative, industry-leading audio streaming company. Bopp is the first music audio streaming service that has a fully integrated MFT (Music Fungible Token) Marketplace. 

Which Gap Does Bopp Fill?
Bopp makes it easy for artists to sell their music as NFTs with our unique marketplace. Users can mint (create) and trade Music NFTs on our marketplace and our mobile app allows users to stream music from their favorite artists. We are maintaining the user experience of music streaming while integrating NFTs which bring more value to users and artists overall.

Our marketplace empowers artist to generate more revenue for their art through offers of exclusive music to fans, crowdfunding (funding which can be put towards albums, equipment, touring, etc.), and trading fees. Music NFTs are the next biggest opportunity for musicians to be fairly compensated for their content.

Version Two we will be integrated with Web3 (Wallet, NFT Marketplace, Token gating). Users will have a Near wallet, allowing users to hold tokens on the Near blockchain and trade NFTs. 

### NFT Marketplace
The Bopp NFT platform allows users to store, display, trade, and mint music NFTs. 
When a music NFT is traded on the Bopp marketplace, the artist receives a royalty based on the percentage set by the artist. Bopp also takes a 2.5% fee from every trade.

### NFT Ticketing
NFT tickets are digital access credentials that offer holders exclusive benefits at the event they attend. 
The tickets are digital assets stored on a blockchain, so the risk of your ticket getting lost, stolen or damaged is relatively low. 
Overtime they will become valuable collectibles, acting as lasting memorabilia.

### Custodian of Private Key

### Transaction Type

# Security
With non-custodial crypto wallets, all personal information remains with users. This reduces the risk of data theft.
Backup and Recovery Possibility
Wallets are under the sole authority of the user.
### Offline Accessibility
Non-Custodial wallets are accessible offline and offer full blockchain development services in real-time. 

# Crowdfunding
On the Bopp Music NFT Marketplace, fans will be able to fund an artist's album in exchange for a share of streaming revenue generated by the album. This is done through the Music NFT Collection drop. 
First, the artist must release their Music NFTs. Artists have the freedom to decide how many units of NFTs they will put up for sale. The artist can then take the proceeds from the launch and apply the proceeds towards creating their album. When their album is available for streaming, investors will receive a percentage (set by the artist) of all the total streaming revenue. 
The Bopp marketplace is effectively eliminating the need for record labels, giving the artist the opportunity to source funds without getting drawn into exploitative contracts. 
Bopp’s music market model enables the revenue from any track streamed on the Bopp Music App to be automatically distributed to the investors and the artist. 
On the Bopp platform, it pays to invest in an artist you believe in. Not only will you have the chance to see them flourish and prosper, but you can also benefit financially from their success. The earlier you invest in your artists, the more you will benefit.
